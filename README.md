# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis –  Data to Decisions Retention Insights

## 🚀 Project Summary

In today’s subscription-based business model, understanding **why customers leave** is just as important as acquiring them. This project identifies key drivers behind customer churn for a telecom company and provides actionable recommendations. Built using **Python (EDA)** and **Power BI**, it demonstrates advanced data handling, analytical thinking, and business storytelling. This project dives deep into a telecommunications dataset to analyze customer churn patterns and uncover actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions. The goal is to understand why customers leave and how to prevent it using data

## 🧩 Business Problem

High churn rates impact profitability, resource planning, and customer lifetime value. Product and marketing teams often lack a clear understanding of churn drivers, leading to reactive rather than proactive measures.

### Challenges Addressed:
- Unstructured and inconsistent customer data
- Difficulty identifying early churn signals
- Lack of clarity around service-level impacts on churn
- Visualizing complex trends for non-technical stakeholders

## 👤 Role & Responsibilities

- 🧼 **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Python (`pandas`, `numpy`), fixing data type mismatches, handling nulls, duplicates, and converting categorical features  
- 🔍 **EDA & Analysis:** Identified key churn drivers like contract type, service usage, tenure, and payment method using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and statistical summaries  
- 📊 **Dashboarding:** Developed **Interactive Power BI dashboards**, showcasing churn KPIs, demographic insights, and service usage patterns  
- 📈 **Business Insight Delivery:** Provided tailored, data-driven recommendations to reduce churn and improve retention

## 🔍 🧠 Data Analysis and Key Insights

### The analysis revealed clear patterns and relationships between churn and several key factors:

- **Tenure Impact:** Most churn occurs within the **first year of service**, indicating onboarding and early experience need improvement  
- **Contract Influence:** Over **55% of churners** are on **month-to-month contracts**, suggesting long-term plans improve retention  
- **Senior Citizens:** Have a higher churn rate, needing tailored service or better support experiences  
- **Service Usage:** Customers **without Tech Support, Online Security, or Streaming services** churn more — lack of engagement leads to loss  
- **Payment Mode:** Churn is higher among those using **electronic check**, possibly due to billing dissatisfaction or lack of trust
